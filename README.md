### About the Project

[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

**Type:** Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA4) project

**Title:** "The role of Patient Initiated Follow-Up and 'Digital Outpatients' in supporting the elective recovery"

**Period:** January-July 2022

**HSMA4 project members:** Martina Fonseca and Xiaochen Ge, NHS England

**HSMA4 mentor:** Dr Alison Harper, U Exeter 

**Full documentation:** [MkDocs repo](https://github.com/nhsengland/HSMA4-12-DES-rheum-mkdocs) (private repo)

**Context**

The pandemic has had a considerable impact on elective care and currently, the waiting list is at its highest on record, with over 6.6 million people waiting for consultant-led elective care [1]. It is estimated that around 6M fewer people completed elective pathways between January 2020 and July 2021 [2]. Operational performance, defined by the proportion of those seen within 18 weeks (target of 92%) has dropped significantly. The proportion seen within 18 weeks has dropped to below 65%[1].

Patient Initiated Follow Up (PIFU) is one of the main tools in the Recovery Plan, alongside other digital solutions such as advice & guidance (A&G) e-referrals.

Advice and guidance allows a clinician to seek advice from another. This may in certain instances mean avoiding an unnecessary GP referral, while seeking advice and guidance from the consultant.

PIFU is where, based on clinical steer, a patient goes on a pathway where they can arrange their own follow-up appointments as-and-when-needed rather than attending regular scheduled appointments. It means for instance that time spent on low clinical value appointments can be repurposed for managing complex patients and upstream care. The interplay between the downstream efficiencies and the upstream referral-to-treatment waiting list, as well as changes to planned levels of resourcing and allocation, can however be hard to grasp.

As such, in this project we propose to use Discrete Event Simulation - where individual patients’ pathway movement through a system with constrained resources is simulated and monitored - to better understand the role that PIFU and other interventions can play in addressing the elective (referral-to-treatment) backlog and supporting patient care.

**Project objectives**
*	Use Discrete Event Simulation to better understand the role patient initiated follow-up (PIFU) can play in addressing the (outpatient and elective) referral-to-treatment (RTT) backlog, with particular emphasis on Rheumatology
*	Advocate and demonstrate the value of pathway and behavioural modelling in central and Integrated Care System decision-making for digital pathway redesign, elective recovery and the Long-Term Plan personalisation agenda and Public Health Management Agenda, to support better patient care, experience and system resilience

We focussed on rheumatology given that rheumatology has a good clinical evidence base on PIFU [5-10]; documented pathways [3,7]; PIFU is actively endorsed [3,4,7]; and that it is a mainly outpatient specialty with many chronic patients on long-term follow-up, meaning that the effect of PIFU may be amplified [3].

### Overview of method

An overview of the simplified pathway / process map, as employed in the DES `simpy` model, is shown below.

### Project Stucture

- The main code is found in the `./scr` folder of the repository (see Usage below for more information)
- The accompanying documentation can be found here (private repo): [MkDocs repo](https://github.com/nhsengland/HSMA4-12-DES-rheum-mkdocs).

### Built With

[![Python v3.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.8-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To run the model locally you will need to have installed GitHub Desktop (or equivalent like git cli), Python and VSCode (or equivalent editors like Spyper).
Below we outline the process with these softwares and based on Windows, but others could be used.

##### 1. Install Github Desktop
- Search and install.
- Set up with github account

##### 2. Install Python
Search and install.

##### 3. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
- Search and install.

##### 4. Getting the code on your PC
- Visit: [https://github.com/nhsx/HSMA4-12-DES-rheum/](https://github.com/nhsx/HSMA4-12-DES-rheum/) 
- click the *<>Code* button and click *Open with GitHub Desktop*
- click the *Clone* button to save/clone the code.
- click *Current Repository*, select *HSMA4-12-DES-rheum* and right-click on the mouse/trackpad and select *Open in Visual Studio Code*; this will open VSCode on a separate window.

#### 5. Setting up VSCode 
- On the VSCode, press the “extensions” button on the left-hand panel (or press Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for “python” and press install.

-	At the top bar, click Terminal > New Terminal (if not in there, click on the three-dot … and click Terminal > New Terminal)

- On the terminal window, use this command
    - ```python -m venv venvpa```
    -	Press Shift + Control + P to open the Command Palette and click on the *Python: Select Interpreter*.
    -	Select the Python interpreter `venvpa`.
    -	Activate the virtual environment using powershell (you may need to change elevation rights):
    ```venvpa\Scripts\activate.ps1```
    - Install all the required libraries by using the command:
        - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    - Or the following:
        - ```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn```
        - ``` pip install simpy streamlit scipy```


### Usage

The main `simpy` model implementation is in `Batch_rheum_Model.py` but the model is run from either a Python script (full flexibility) or an interactive web app (GUI but more limited user parameters).

#### Via Python script or Jupyter notebook

Run `simpy_rheum_v004_run.py` in Python (spyder, VS Code) or from `simpy_rheum_v004_notebook.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook). 
If using the Python notebook, use ```pip install ipykernel``` and select the interpreter as `venvpa` above. The cells can then be run.

#### Via a Toy Tool (Streamlit)

A prototype toy interactive app leveraging streamlit was also worked on in Streamlit.

For local machine deployment: the script can be found here `streamlit_model_mf_v0031_batch.py`.

Overview instructions:
- Navigate to code folder in terminal / powershell by typing `cd src` .
- Type in terminal / powershell `streamlit run streamlit_model_mf_v0031_batch.py`.

Detailed instructions: see [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPUk__mXLI) for guidance.

#### Post-processing scripts

Some post-processing scripts for the generated logs from the simulation have been created in R, see [https://github.com/nhsx/HSMA4-12-DES-rheum/post-processing](https://github.com/nhsx/HSMA4-12-DES-rheum/tree/main/post-processing). These include:
- Plots of KPIs across scenarios and replications, as shown in example outputs below (with `ggplot2`)
- Process mapping outputs (with `bupaR`)

  These will need adapting for new outputs and experiments.


### Example outputs

#### Illustrative use case ("V3"), a stylistic trust

As an example of the model in operation, we aimed to create a hypothetical baseline case for a fictitious trust with realistic parameters and assumptions.

#### Illustrative use case ("V3") - parameters

We obtained parameter inputs from GIRFT guidance, NHS Digital, clinical data and publications to build a hypothetical baseline case for a fictitious trust with realistic parameters and assumptions, including reasonable resulting waiting list characteristics.

We then applied what-if modelling to this baseline case based on PIFU or A&G interventions.

Some details of parameters for the use case, both the baseline and what-if, can be found below (for full details within script and - upon request - via project report).

![plot - V3 parameters](./readme-figures/model_usecaseV3_parameters.PNG)

![plot - V3 what-if scenarios](./readme-figures/model_usecaseV3_whatifs.PNG)

#### Illustrative use case ("V3") - outputs

Some outputs are shown below:

![plot of KPI median waiting time over the last observation year, for use case "V3". Baseline and what-if scenarios](./readme-figures/scenarios_RTT_q0.5.png)

![plot of median waiting time over time (three year observation period), for use case "V3". Baseline and what-if scenarios](./readme-figures/scenarios_RTT_q05_dt.png)

![plot of Waiting List size over time (three year observation period), for use case "V3". Baseline and what-if scenarios](./readme-figures/scenarios_RTT_WT_dt.png)

nb: `simpy` output logs themselves not uploaded to repo due to size. Can be regenerated with the code given (the current parameters are set to match scenario A above, for the use case "V3"). The plots were created upon post-processing of `simpy` logs of appointments and patients across simulated scenarios, with R script `80-postprocessing_plots.R`.
